📊 YouTube Audience Engagement Analysis

Analyze YouTube video comments using NLP techniques such as Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, and Topic Modeling to uncover audience insights and engagement patterns.

📌 Project Overview

This project extracts YouTube comments from a given video URL and performs end-to-end Natural Language Processing to:

- Understand audience sentiment

- Identify frequently discussed topics

- Extract important entities and keywords

- Visualize engagement insights interactively

- It demonstrates practical implementation of web scraping, NLP pipelines, and data visualization in a production-style workflow.
